# :godmode: shkm's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, managed with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

No promises are made about stability or portability, but feel free to use anything you find useful.

I primarily use the following right now:

- MacOS
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
