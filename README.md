# :godmode: shkm's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, managed using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). They're designed for me and subject to change at any time, but feel free to take bits and pieces.

Over the years I've used some pretty esoteric setups; nowadays I'm more focused on Getting Shit Done, and as a result my dotfiles are becoming more spartan.


Current setup involves this software amongst others:

- PopOS
- IntelliJ IDEs
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
