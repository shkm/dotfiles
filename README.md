# :godmode: shkm's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, managed using [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager). They're designed for me and subject to change at any time, but feel free to take bits and pieces.

Previously I used GNU Stow to manage these.


## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:shkm/dotfiles.git ~/.config/nixpkgs
home-manager switch
```
